Hello there... I'm Obewon

1. Spawn apples/fruits/whatever for the snake to eat.
2. Get the snake to move
3. Debug: WindowManager.cpp does not clear the screen like it is supposed to.
4. Currently the WindowManager only tracks the snake's collision with itself. It needs to track collision with the walls as well.
